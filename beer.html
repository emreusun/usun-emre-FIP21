First brewed in 1995, our flagship Classic Ale has become a signature beer of the Ontario region. Unmistakable with its rich amber colour and inviting floral tones, this laid-back, English pub-style ale is smooth and easy-going. With a Cascade hoppiness and full body of flavour, this gold-medal winning Classic Ale is the quintessential taste of cottage country.
</p>
<p>Our flavour is A smooth, rich malt body with a slight caramel sweetness, balanced by low hop bitterness and you can taste our Toffee, caramel, light floral taste. Our beer is made from 2 Row Pale Malt, Crystal 40, and Toasted Wheat Flakes. You can get this beer every liquor store around hole Ontario and BC. Also we are planning to sell our beer around USA and Europe market. In the future you can get your Classic Ale at everywhere :) </p>

          <h2>WHITE ALE BEER</h2>
          <p>This brew can range from a light amber/white to a dark brown with light hues and typically has an ABV in the 4-4.5% range. The beer variety also has certain contrasting elements that attract many of its drinkers. While White Ales are darker and usually rich, they also contain components of a much lighter beer with a dry, crisp and hoppy finish. </p>

<p>Due to their robust nature, these beers pair wonderfully with food. The toasty malt flavor and light fruitiness allow the White Ale to pair well with cheeses like Gruyère and mild Derby Cheddar. Whereas the balanced nature and ability to remain subtle, not overpowering, makes the beer a good match with poultry like grilled chicken or turkey, and lighter sandwiches.</p>

<p>As a whole, White Ales are expected to possess a range of ’mediums.’ This means that according to style guidelines, White Ales should have a medium or slightly fuller body, medium levels of fruity aromas and flavors common in IPAs, medium hop bitterness and flavors, and medium to slightly fuller malt character. On all aspects of the beer variety, it should be medium.

          <h2>RED ALE BEER</h2>
          <p>Red Ales originate from Europe and refers to styles of beer that are dark red or are reddish in appearance. This brew style is still, to some extent, waiting for its big break and to secure a spot amongst the more easily recognized beer styles.</p>

<p>Red Ales can almost be thought of as the European version of an American Amber Ale since ‘red’ and ‘amber’ are essentially describing the same full-flavored, hoppy, buttery beer. Currently Red Ales are stuck sharing a category with American Amber Ales at the Great American Beer Festival, this category being a catchall for anything that is not a dark ale, not clearly a pale ale, and does not quite fit in with brown ales. While these American Amber Ale and Red Ale beer styles are comparable to each other, the Red Ale is ready to stand on its own! </p>

<p>Historically, Red Ales, unlike American Amber Ales, use specialty roasted malts that create a unique complexity within the finished beer, give it a sweeter, butterscotch or caramelized flavor, and allow it to achieve the reddish color. The use of American hops varieties gives the brew very bold hops characteristics and tends to leave a dry finish. American Amber Ales on the other hand, rely on caramelized malts to obtain their color and flavors.
